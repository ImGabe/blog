## About me

I'm Gabe, a computer cience student at [UERJ]. Study on Rust, Go and functional programming.

Here is my [github] and you can also contact me via [email].

## Why?

Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I felt I should share my suffering experiences, either to help someone else who wants to venture down the same path or just to record my idiocies. All my not-so-usual experiences with any technology that looks interesting or anything else that I think needs will be documented.

## How?

This blog is made with [Zola] and [Nix] and is hosted on my [github]. I chose to use [Zola] because of the simplicity and ease that this static site engine offers, besides the fact that it makes my daily routine even more rusty. [Nix] has been part of my routine for a few years now, however, [flake] is a great novelty that has been pleasing me a lot for the practicality of setting up a development environment.
