It had been a long time since I had been hiking, even though I really enjoyed it, so I was a little unprepared. I forgot to bring sunscreen, repellent and I didn't bring much water. But it didn't bother me. I think it took me about 45 minutes to climb with my group.

## Flamengo beach

It is an easily accessible trail near Flamengo beach, very quiet and even busy, there are some stairs that make the path easier and signs to indicate it. You can go up using the cable car, it is a little expensive, but if you want to go to an event at the top it is the way to go.

I wanted to go to the beach, but I didn't have time :(

## Hiking

I found it well preserved and peaceful, you will find some foreigners, a lot of people climbing as if it were something they normally do and some tired people getting in the way.

I almost slipped 2~3 times while trying to get down quickly, I saw a man going down really fast and I tried to do the same... go down calmly and everything will be fine!

## Sugar Loaf Mountains

I'm happy to see that you are preserving our bees!!

A great structure, it has a cool samba/pagode, sometimes there is a show, it has some children's spaces and places to eat, a very cool place to go with family, friends or even alone.

The view is very beautiful, but everything is very expensive... I don't recommend buying anything up there...
